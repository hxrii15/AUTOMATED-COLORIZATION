**ABSTRACT **

	This project focuses on leveraging Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the automatic colorization of grayscale images. The aim is to develop an AI-driven system capable of transforming monochrome or black and white images into vibrant, realistic color representations. 
Using CNN architectures tailored for image colorization, the project involves training a model on a dataset of grayscale images paired with their corresponding color images. The deep neural network learns the complex mapping between grayscale intensity values and their corresponding color information. 
During the colorization process, the trained CNN automatically infers and predicts the missing color information based on the grayscale input. Through its learned patterns and representations, the model accurately generates color details, providing a natural and visually appealing transformation from grayscale to color.


**Conclusions**

	Developments in deep learning have made many tasks that would have been difficult for humans easier. Fine coloring of high-resolution images is one such problem that is very difficult for humans. This thesis provides an overview of previous advances in image coloring using deep learning methods. Also, as existing networks are not effective in fine-grained coloring of high-resolution images, this thesis proposes non-local coloring generative adversarial networks for image coloring. Improvements are proposed for the existing generative adversarial networks in terms of instability of the training process, convergence, loss function, etc.
